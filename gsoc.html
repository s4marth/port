		<h3>Google Summer of code 2022 - Deadland</h3>

		<p>Build a 2D action-packed game on Catroid, block coding, and visual programming language called Deadland forInternational catrobat Association. It’s a single player zombie based game
		<br>
		<br>
		Designed and implemented features that prevented the game from lagging, increased game speed by 2x and maximised user efficiency.
		<br>
		<br>
		Over 36000+ downloads have been made so far. More than 2k lines of code were written from scratch to implement all the designs and code
		<br>
		<br>
		Made four versions of it, all are available on pocketcode app as well as on Github.
        An Awesome Demo Game which is playable on both phones as well as on smart TV when cast made in Catrobat Visual Programming Language. The game is ispired with many Zombie based ames like Zombieville. The main character of the game is 'Mark' who is the hero and has ability to save the whole city with this destruction. At each level, Mark will fight with Zombies and creatures sent by the main villain 'Goliath'. and In the last level Mark will fight with our main Villain 'Goliath' and defeat him and save the city with this disaster by ejecting the antidode. The player follows mark in his journey. The game story is easily depicted through cinematic cutscenes for better insight. The game is very easy to play and get into, with on-screen controls, and a fairly simple UI. The game is playable on both phones and on a smart TV without looking at the phone's screen while using the phone as a gamepad. This game shows how the ‘Pocket Code’ app can be used to develop high-quality video games if used efficiently and effectively.

            All the project files, along with the amount of content they hold, are in the “Assets” document in the directory. All the assets and music files are present in above github repository. The(.catrobat) file can be imported into your Pocket Code app.
            All the ".catrobat" files of each version of game are also present on Google drive : <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ikfwE-4ENUtAiYUnofv5NVY7JvWIDVog?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ikfwE-4ENUtAiYUnofv5NVY7JvWIDVog?usp=sharin</a>
